## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository!

I'm a front-end developer with a strong focus on building modern, accessible web applications using TypeScript and Angular. My work revolves around creating intuitive, responsive user interfaces that not only look great but are also usable by everyone, regardless of ability. This repository is a collection of personal projects, learning experiments, and best practices Iâ€™ve picked up along the way.

I specialize in Angular and have experience crafting scalable applications using component-based architecture, reactive forms, and state management tools like NgRx. TypeScript is at the core of my development process, helping me write safer, more maintainable code while building complex UIs. I believe in writing clean, readable code and designing features that are both functional and inclusive.

Accessibility is a top priority in my projects. I strive to build applications that meet WCAG standards and provide a seamless experience for users who rely on assistive technologies. From semantic HTML to keyboard navigation and ARIA roles, Iâ€™m always looking for ways to make the web a more accessible place.

This repository includes a variety of projectsâ€”some are small and focused, others are more complete web appsâ€”that demonstrate my technical skills and commitment to continuous learning. Youâ€™ll find examples of reusable components, custom directives, routing setups, and more.

Whether you're a fellow developer, a learner, or just passing through, feel free to explore the code, fork a project, or share feedback. Collaboration and community are a big part of what makes web development exciting, and I'm always open to learning from others and growing together.

Thanks for visiting, and I hope you find something here that inspires or helps you in your own development journey.
